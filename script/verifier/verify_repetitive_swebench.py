        evaluate_prompt = f"""

## Context

The agent produced:
- **Thinking**: Its internal reasoning before taking the next step. This is what you will evaluate.
- **Action**: The tool call or edit it plans to execute next. (Note: You will NOT evaluate the action itself). # Explicitly state action is not evaluated

Additionally, the agent has already repeated this action multiple times.

## Provided Information
---
Agent's Thinking:
{thinking}

Agent's Current Action (JSON):
{json.dumps(current_action, indent=2)}

Previously Repeated Action (JSON):
{json.dumps(repetitive_action, indent=2)}

{action_note} # This note is useful context for the evaluator to confirm if the action is indeed repetitive or changed.

## Scoring Rubric: Thinking Evaluation Only (0-2 points)

- **2 (Aware and Adjusting)**:
  The agent's thinking process **explicitly recognizes it is repeating** the same action or type of action that failed, and **shows clear intent to change or stop** the repetitive behavior in the next step.

- **1 (Aware but No Adjustment)**:
  The agent's thinking process **mentions or clearly realizes** it has already repeated this action, **but still states an intent to do it again without planning any changes** to break the repetition or bypass the issue.

- **0 (Unaware or Stuck)**:
  The agent's thinking process **shows no awareness** of having repeated the same action multiple times. It continues its reasoning as if the current attempt were the first, without acknowledging the history of failed repetitions.

# Removed Action Evaluation section entirely

## Instructions
        Please evaluate **only the agent's Thinking** based on the 0-2 point Scoring Rubric above.
        Provide **only** the thinking evaluation score (0, 1, or 2) and the reason for that score.
